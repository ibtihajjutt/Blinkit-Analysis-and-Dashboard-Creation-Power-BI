# Blinkit-Analysis-and-Dashboard-Creation-Power-BI
This project includes a Power BI dashboard that demonstrates data analysis and sales forecasting using time series analysis on simulated data. The project focuses on creating an intuitive user experience while highlighting the power of data-driven insights through visualizations .
🌟 Objective
The goal of this practice project was to explore how data analysis and forecasting could be applied to improve business decision-making. By analyzing simulated sales trends and creating forecasts, I aimed to demonstrate how data can provide clear insights to drive business growth.

🖥️ Dashboard Creation
I built a beautiful and easy-to-navigate dashboard using Power BI. With interactive visualizations and filters, the dashboard allows users to explore data at various levels and uncover insights effortlessly. The focus was on highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) to enable simple, data-driven decision-making.

👤 User-Centric Design
In this practice project, I used simulated data to analyze sales strategies and identify potential areas for improvement. Through clear charts and visualizations, users can easily see how decisions impact performance, making it easy to evaluate strategies.

📈 Sales Forecasting
Using time series analysis on the simulated data, I developed a robust sales forecast model to predict performance over the next 15 days. These forecasts showcase how businesses can plan smarter and anticipate customer demand.
